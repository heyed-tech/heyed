EYFS Updates – September 2025

From 1 September 2025, a new EYFS statutory framework applies. The main changes are in safeguarding and welfare requirements:

• Safeguarding policies
Providers must have written safeguarding policies that clearly set out how safer recruitment is carried out. This includes obtaining professional references (not personal or open references), verifying them properly, and keeping records of checks. Policies must also describe how unsuitable individuals are prevented from working with children.

• Whistleblowing
All settings must provide a clear process for staff and volunteers to raise concerns about practice, leadership, or safeguarding failures. This must include internal reporting routes and external channels, such as contacting Ofsted or the NSPCC, so staff feel safe to speak up.

• Child absence monitoring
Providers must actively monitor patterns of absence. Unexplained or frequent absences must be followed up to check on the child's welfare. Each child must have at least two emergency contact details recorded to make sure parents or carers can always be reached.

• Safeguarding training (Annex C)
The framework now sets out more detail on safeguarding training. Providers must show how training is delivered, how often it is refreshed, and how staff embed it in daily practice. Records of training must be kept up to date so it is clear who has received training and when.

• Paediatric First Aid (PFA)
Students, apprentices, or new staff can only be counted in staff-to-child ratios if they hold a valid paediatric first aid certificate and have been judged competent by their employer. This ensures ratios do not include untrained staff.

• Safer eating
Providers must take clear steps to reduce the risk of choking. This includes preparing food safely (e.g. cutting grapes lengthways, avoiding hard or round foods), supervising children closely during meals, and creating calm mealtime environments. All allergies and dietary needs must be recorded, and individual action plans must be in place to support children with medical conditions. Staff must also be trained to respond effectively if a child chokes.

• Toileting and nappy changing
Children's privacy must be respected, but staff must balance this with safeguarding. Only one child should be changed at a time, and procedures must prevent opportunities for abuse. Records of nappy changing or toileting must be maintained, and supervision is required to make sure policies are being followed correctly.
